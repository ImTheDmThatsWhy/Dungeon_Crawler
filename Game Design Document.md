- **Perspective:** (e.g., Top-down, isometric, etc.)
- **Number of Players:** (Single-player/Multiplayer)

## **Key Features:**

1. **Procedurally Generated Dungeons:** (How will dungeons be generated, what variety will exist?)

   - Classic dungeon with grey brick walls and grey tiled floors.
   - Sylvan dungeon with overgrown trees and mossy stone walls.
   - Volcanic dungeon with lava and fiery rocks.
   - Water themed dungeon with sea creatures and coral reefs.
   - Frozen dungeon with ice and snow.
   - Desert dungeon with sand and cacti.

2. **Resource Management:** (How will players manage health, stamina, or inventory?)
3. **Combat System:** (What types of combat and weapons will be available?)
   - Melee Weapons
   - Ranged Weapons
   - Magic
   - Potions
   - Shields
   - Armour
   - Artifacts/Trinkets/Idols/Effigies/Curios
   - Gems - Elemental Aspects for enchanted weapons, granting magical abilities
4. **Loot System:** (What kinds of loot can players collect?)
   - Weapons
   - Armour
   - Spells
   - Ranged Weapons
   - Potions
   - coins
   - Artifacts/Trinkets/Idols/Effigies/Curios
   - Gems

5. **AI Enemies:** (Describe enemy types and behaviors.)

   - Idle movement
   - Aggressive movement and attack
   - Defensive movement and shield/block.
   - Aggressive movement with a chance to attack and flee
   - Aggressive movement with a chance to flee and use ranged attack
   - special abilities

6. **Boss Battles:** (Will there be bosses? How will they function?)
   - Bosses could be the end of a dungeon series or run, and can have a health bar, with a special ability that will be used to defeat them. Such as using fire spells, or using a shield to block attacks.
   - Could randomly generate bosses from a series of abilities and stats or mechanics.
7. **Exploration and Traps:** (How will traps and exploration affect gameplay?)
   - Using traps as a way to block paths, requiring disarming them to continue, or using traps as a way to damage enemies.
   - Exploration could be a way to find hidden items, or to find a way to progress further.
8. **Progression and Upgrades:** (How can players upgrade their character?)
   - Could have stats to upgrade adding an rpg element.
   - Upgrade weapons, armour, spells, ranged weapons and abilities.

## **Game Flow:**

1. **Start Menu:** (What options are available to the player at the start?)
   _Ideas for start menu:_

   - classic: explore at own pace, decent health bar, any additional items, starting weapons ect
   - Timed: Put the player on a time limit to reach the end
   - Hard core: less health/ lives, no weapon or start items, could even go for instant death if a character dies once, no save points

2. **Exploration:** (How will players explore dungeons?)
3. **Combat:** (What will combat feel like? Real-time/turn-based?)
   - Combat could be real-time for more engaging and fun gameplay.
4. **Loot and Progression:** (How will loot affect progression?)
5. **Boss Battle:** (Will there be boss encounters? How will they be structured?)
   - 2 to 5 phases per boss as difficulty increases, changing combat dynamics and mechanics. Requiring different strategies and tactics to overcome.
6. **Victory/Defeat:** (What signifies the end of a game session?)
   - Victory: player reaches the end of the dungeon, or defeats the final boss.
   - Defeat: player dies, or fails to complete the game within the time limit.
7. **Encumberance:** (if a player is going to have items, loot, and weapons, should encumberance be a thing? How will it affect game-play, combat ect?)
   - Encumberance could be a way to limit the amount of items a player can carry, or to make it harder to move around. Perhaps the player has limited bag space and each item/stack of items takes up a space.

## **Visual and Audio Style:**

- **Art Style:** (Serious, cartoonish, pixel art, 3D, etc.)
  - Do we have any 2d artists? Can start with placeholder art for now.
- **Dungeon Theme:** (What will the environment look like?)
  - Could have a variety of dungeons, each with their own theme and style.
- **Character Design:** (What will the player character look like?)
- **Sound Design:** (What type of music and sound effects will be used?)
  - Could have a variety of music and sound effects, each with their own theme and style.
  - Including sound effects for weapons, spells, and other actions.

## **Core Mechanics:**

1. **Combat System:**
   - **Weapons:** (Melee, ranged, magic? Weapon variety?)
   - **Stamina:** (Will stamina affect combat and movement?)
2. **Resource Management:**

   - **Health:** (How will players heal?)
   - **Mana/Other Resources:** (What resources will players manage?)
     - Mana could be a way to limit the amount of spells a player can cast, or to make it harder to cast spells.
     - Coins could be used as currency in an ingame economy system to buy items, or to buy upgrades. (Stretch - if multiplayer is added and if items have random attributes, we could have a virtual auction house for players to buy and sell items.)

3. **Enemy AI:**
   - **Behavior:** (How will enemies behave in combat? Are there different types?)

---

## **Level Design:**

- **Procedurally Generated Rooms:** (How will dungeons be laid out? Room variety?)
- **Dungeon Environment:** (Describe the overall theme, design, and elements of the dungeons.)
- **End of Dungeon Boss:** (How will the end of a dungeon be structured?)

---

## **User Interface (UI):**

- **Health, Mana, and Stamina Bars:** (How will this information be presented to the player?)
- **Mini-map:** (Will there be a map? How will it function?)
